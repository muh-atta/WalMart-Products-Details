# ðŸ›’ Walmart Product Scraper

This project automatically scrapes product data from [Walmart.com](https://www.walmart.com) using Puppeteer, and saves it in two formats:

- **`walmart-data.json`** â€“ latest scraped data (overwritten every run)
- **`walmart-data.csv`** â€“ log of all scraped data (appended on every run)

It is integrated with GitHub Actions to run every **Friday at 9:00 AM** and commit the updated data files to the repository.
